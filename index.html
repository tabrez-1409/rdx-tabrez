                <p class="small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which
                    falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various
                    articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act,
                    2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The
                    approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3.</p>

                <p class="small">In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for males and
                    65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18, 84.7% for
                    male and 70.3% for female.[10] This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and
                    29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%.[11] India's improved education system is often cited as
                    one of the main contributors to its economic development.[12][13] Much of the progress, especially
                    in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While
                    enrolment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross
                    Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 26.3% in 2019,[14] there still remains a significant distance to catch up
                    with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations,[15] a challenge that will be
                    necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively
                    young population.[citation needed]

                    Demand for private schools has been growing over the years.[16]While a consensus over what is the
                    most significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet emerged, some authors have
                    attributed this to a higher demand for English-medium education[17], a dissatisfaction with the
                    quality of public schools,[18][19] greater affordability of private schools,[16] and
                    non-availability of preferred field of study in government schools.[20] After the adoption of the
                    Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, private schools were required to be 'government-recognised'. A
                    private school would be eligible for government recognition when it met certain conditions</p>

                <p class="small">Fresh Little Minds ‘Lets GROW Together’ programme is a targeted early intervention
                    programme tier 2–3 intervention for carers/parents and child/ren to undertake together.
                    This intervention has been successful in supporting and deescalating the stresses experienced by
                    many families on waiting lists for CAMHS & ASD services. Parents/carers are empowered to become
                    proactive in supporting their own children’s emotional wellbeing and coping strategies. Results have
                    included a reduction in overwhelm, more empowered parents, and a clinical prediction for reduced
                    risk for mental disorders including depression, anxiety, concentration disorder and ASD.
                    This initiative aims to improve the health and wellbeing of parents & children through nurturing
                    resilience.
